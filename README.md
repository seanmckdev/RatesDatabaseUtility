# RatesDatabaseDownloader
Program I used with OandaDataFetcher to create flat-file historical quotes from Oanda

# How to use

After downloading the data from Oanda using my other program "OandaDataFetcher" I used this program to create a csv file from the data.
I only ran this from within my development enviroment, which worked fine for my purposes.
Change the variables "url", "user", and "password" (found in Main.java) to your database and username/password.
